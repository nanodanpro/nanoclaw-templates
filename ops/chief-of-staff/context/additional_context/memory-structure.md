# Memory structure for this role (one-time setup)

Guidance for one part of your memory: the folders this template's persona, skills, and
tasks rely on. Everything else about how your memory works stays as your memory system
defines it; this file only says where this role's learned material lives so the rest can
find it. In your first working session, create the folders below inside `memory/`, each
with its own `index.md`, and link them from the Map in `memory/index.md`. The persona,
skills, and tasks refer to these paths, so keep the names exact. Re-read this file if the
layout drifts.

## `memory/principal.md`: who you serve

The verified identity of your principal: their name, job or role, company, timezone, and
the working relationship (where the line sits between what you handle yourself and what
comes back to them). Resolve the `[principal]`, `[job_title]`, and `[company]`
placeholders from connected sources or one concise question in the first session and save
the confirmed values here, so the same template can serve a CEO, founder, investor, or
operator without changing the playbook. Correct in place as the relationship changes.

## `memory/commitments/`: the running list

The always-on spine of the role: everything open on the principal's plate — unanswered
messages, commitments they made or are owed, upcoming deadlines. Each item carries an
owner, a due date, a status, and a link to its evidence. This is not triggered by a
scenario; it is every session. Re-read it fresh at the start of each session (an injected
copy can be stale) and write it back after every change — an update left only in a reply
is lost. The folder's `index.md` is the live list, most time-sensitive first; group by
front or project as it grows. Starts empty; the first session builds it from the
principal's email, files, and transcripts.

## `memory/priorities/`: what matters (the importance model)

Consulted before any decision about what to surface, rank, protect, or escalate. Built
once in the first working session — adopt the principal's existing sense of priority if
it's visible in how they already work, otherwise propose and commit only once agreed —
then corrected in place: every "that wasn't important" or "always surface this" updates a
file here. One concept per file:

* `people.md` (`type: priorities`): whose messages and requests always surface — board,
  co-founder, key customers, whoever the principal will move things for.
* `fronts.md` (`type: priorities`): the two or three outcomes that matter right now,
  ranked, so competing items sort against real priorities rather than apparent urgency.
* `escalate-on-sight.md` (`type: policy`): signals that always reach the principal
  immediately — a decision only they can make, a top-priority person waiting, a
  reputational or legal risk, anything time-critical and irreversible.
* `noise.md` (`type: policy`): what looks urgent here but isn't — newsletters, cc-only
  threads, vendor pings, routine notifications — so it doesn't crowd out what matters.

## `memory/conventions/`: how the principal works

Learned conventions the skills follow so output stays consistent, and so the principal
never has to re-teach you. Adopted from how they already work, or proposed and committed
once agreed. Every correction lands on the file it's about, in one line, so nothing is
learned twice. Expected files:

* `triage-scheme.md` (`type: convention`): the inbox buckets, the drafting rules
  (e.g. "always draft replies to the board"), and the do-not-touch threads.
* `scheduling-preferences.md` (`type: convention`): meeting windows and no-meeting days,
  default durations and buffers, color and naming conventions, priority people, and what
  never moves.
* `project-conventions.md` (`type: convention`): the source of truth (tracker, board,
  doc), the status format the principal likes, the review cadence and where status is
  sent, and the escalation line — what you chase yourself vs. what reaches the principal.

New conventions the agent learns (a `voice-guide.md` for how the principal writes, a
`brief-format.md` if the morning brief shape is tuned) join this folder the same way:
adopted or proposed-and-committed, then corrected in place.
